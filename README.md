Please share and play this game as often and as in many places as you like - and kindly provide feedback (through the issue tracker or via email) so we can keep making it better.

Feel free to modify the plain text files (rpg-roles and facilitators_guide) with improvements, and submit a pull request for me to modify the printable pdfs accordingly.
